I'm Nich, a 25-year-old currently living and working in Bangkok. I spent most of my childhood and teenage years in the Middle East - first in beautiful Oman, then later Bahrain - before heading to California to pursue my undergraduate degree. In the Spring of 2016, I graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Molecular & Cell Biology and Psychology. Although my formal education was in the sciences I have since adopted a more interdisciplinary approach to self-development, driven mainly by curiosity. 

### Writing

I created this portfolio/blog hybrid in an effort to document my personal development, professional ventures, hobbies and artistic interests. After years of on-and-off journaling, I have found that writing is an excellent way for me to organize thoughts and reflect on experiences. Throughout my time in vastly different climates and cultures, I have developed a diverse array of interests. With this space, I will try to log them and share my learnings - in everything ranging from a career in tech, personal investing, spontaneous travel, and record collecting, to blockchain technology and programming - hopefully some of these reflections will start a conversation or at least help others on their own journeys.

This space serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts and knowledge. The blog posts will generally fall under the broad categories of life updates, educational posts (about both technology and art), and essays about my thoughts on current events. As a delve deeper into the blockchain rabbit whole, I collate the fundamental ideas and present them in a step-by-step manner on my blog.

I'm a fan of open source and contribute writing where I can, like [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) and [cryptoeconomics.study](cryptoeconomics.study)

### Coding

Learning full-stack software development is one of the best decisions and investments I have made. I started off with Swift because I wanted to make an app for record collections, and then moved on to Ruby on Rails and web development. Now I'm working on decentralized applications powered by blockchain technology.

Some things I built during my journey
- **Dig my Crate**: A Rails app to poke around my record collection [[website](https://digmycrate.herokuapp.com)][[code](https://github.com/nichanank/digmycrate)]
- **CryptoFPL**: A Fantasy Premier League game powered by Ethereum. This was my final project for ConsenSys Academy's [Blockchain Developer Bootcamp](https://consensys.net/academy/bootcamp/) [[code](https://github.com/nichanank/crypto-fpl)]
- **Minimum Viable Bitcoin**: A lightweight implementation of a UTXO blockchain. Written in Python. [code](https://github.com/nichanank/minimum-viable-bitcoin)]

I currently work a lot with Ethereum smart contracts, React, NodeJS, and postgreSQL. 

Want to explore: games development, more mobile app development, building decentralized applications on layer 2.

### Photography

I take lots of photos but especially enjoy film photography. I bought myself a [Nikon FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM) in late 2017 and have been enamoured by the medium, the process, and the results since. I plan to create a portfolio of just my film photos but for now the selected ones can be found on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/nichanank)
